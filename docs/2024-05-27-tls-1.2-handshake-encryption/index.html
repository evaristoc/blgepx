                    <p>Once the legitimacy of the Server was confirmed, the Client will encrypt a secret for the Server. It is called asymmetric because after an encryption operation, the other side will need a different but related key to decrypt the message.</p>

                    <p>During the asymmetric phase the parties will use an asymmetric algorithm known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a>. The parties will make use of the server keys (see <a href="https://evaristoc.github.io/re-versing/blog/security-and-access/2024/02/17/tls-ssl-v1.2-handshake-made-simple-hellos.html" target="_blank">previous post</a>). The Client has a copy of the public one (as possibly everyone else) for encryption, but it is expected that only the Server knows the private key for decryption. The Server is the one who choose the cipher to use.</p>

                    <p> <strong>Why not simply using the pre-master secret instead?</strong> Let's use our early example to understand why. Try to imagine the pre-master as a random mix of <i>hundreds of characters</i> from <i>several different alphabets</i>. But to encrypt and decrypt a message written with a Latin alphabet of only 26 characters, we don't need them all. A random selection of <i>a fixed amount (in this case 26) of those characters</i> would be our master secret. This is more or less the idea that justify the construction of the master secret from a pre-master.</p>

                    <p>The master secret and the randoms will be used to create the <strong>session keys</strong> using a similar procedure as for the creation of the master secret. Both parties produce <i>more than one key</i> in a single <strong>key block</strong> that is eventually "sliced" up to the right sizes. The resulting session keys would fit the symmetric cipher previously negotiated between the parties. The keys are ready: <strong>we can move to the next phase</strong>.</p>
